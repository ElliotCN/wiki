## Introduction

This Code of Conduct is intended as a guide and support to all LightForm colleagues, defining how the LightForm team will operate, in order to foster an inclusive work environment, in which to successfully deliver our project goals. 

It sets out standards of practice which the team are expected to follow when within, or representing LightForm.  

This code is not exhaustive, and it is important that individuals seek advice and guidance if necessary. 

## Code of Conduct briefing:

All team members will be briefed, in addition, the induction programme for all new colleagues will reinforce the principles of this code. 

## Code of Conduct

### Professional growth, development and training

Take ownership for your own professional growth, development and training. Utilise the relevant training and development opportunities provided through the Staff Learning and Development Unit 

If specific development and training requirements are not provided in-house, speak to your Supervisor. Provision may be available to arrange group or individual training through an external provider. 

Actively develop and grow skills and expertise by taking your Professional Development Review (PDR) and One to One meetings seriously and invest time in the discussion and planning of your development. Discuss expectations and career aspirations and seek feedback.

### Keeping our team safe

We are committed to the implementation and maintenance of the highest standards of health, safety and welfare and we all have an important role in maintaining a healthy and safe environment.

Whilst on University business, it is your responsibility to take reasonable care of your own and othersâ€™ safety by adopting safe working practices and making proper use of the safety facilities provided.

You can do this by complying with University Health and Safety Policies and Codes of Practice, which cover activities conducted within, or on behalf of the University. This applies not only on University premises, but anywhere else that you may be working.

We all have a duty of care in the workplace, therefore if you see anything that may be a health and safety breach and is likely to cause harm, you must speak up and report it to the appropriate health and safety officials immediately.

### Keeping our information safe

The University not only holds personal data about you, it also holds a vast amount of sensitive material, for example in relation to our research.

The University must protect this information and ensure that it is not shared internally, or externally, with those who have no right to it. We all, therefore, have an important responsibility to keep information safe and secure.

Publicising and sharing of LightForm outputs, research findings, IP, collaborations and other sensitive information is strictly prohibited.

You must seek written authorisation from your supervisor in advance, regarding any communications for social media, press or broadcast media.

Where appropriate we aim to make all research reproducible and accessible, subject to the constraints of the specific project, through quality science data collection and archiving procedures.

### Our work space

Our work space is one which encourages inclusive participation and does not tolerate discrimination or harassment.

Discrimination and harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

We will work in an environment where challenging negative behaviour is the norm and those who challenge will be supported at a senior level.
A colleagues position or status will not deter others from addressing their behaviour. 

Harassment and discrimination by and/or of members of our team will not be tolerated in any form. 

### How we communicate and support one another

Effective methods of communication create a happier work environment at all levels and support all team members to feel valued and acknowledged.

To successfully communicate with and support one another we will:

-	Be mindful of the positive impact of something as simple as greeting and thanking colleagues (good morning/ hello) has on the mood of the working environment
-	Foster a supportive team culture of sharing ideas and helping each other, promoting feedback, candid open discussion, critical reflection and continually incorporate it into next stage/meeting
-	Recognise that mistakes are an opportunity to learn and develop
-	Operate a safe working environment where we listen to, and respect others 
-	Hold regular One to One meetings and regular team meetings, which we prioritise our attendance at 
-	Make time for and engage with team socials/away days/lunches, recognising the importance of connecting with colleagues outside of the work space
-	Consider the thoughts and expectations of others by asking for and paying attention to feedback from colleagues
-	Be empathic, compassionate and considerate while remaining professional

### How we operate as a team

By working in a planned and measured way, we can deliver positive, timely outcomes. 

We will therefore:  

-	Have task based meetings and clear project timelines
-	Have a schedule of meetings set up in advance
-	Set clear objectives with realistic deadlines, sharing progress and outputs via weekly group progress meetings, updating spreadsheet summary and meeting notes for Dropbox
-	Attend required progress meetings, inform colleagues if you are unable to attend with sufficient notice, and promptly complete any outstanding actions resulting from non-attendance
-	Achieve tasks within deadline
-	Plan in advance to give people warning about activities and time to achieve the task
-	Discuss and agree priorities and time table
-	Forecast  what will be needed in the future
-	Proactively share resources, information and expertise, 
-	Share resources, information and expertise by utilising SLACK as an essential, inclusive group communication tool  

### Flexible working hours

Core campus working hours are 10am to 4.00am Monday to Friday in order to facilitate collaborative working. Meetings and events will not be arranged outside these hours. 
Exceptions for these core hours can be arranged in line with University and Departmental policy.

Avoid sending work-related email outside of 8.00am and 6.00pm, colleagues are not required, or should feel obliged to reply to emails outside of their typical work hours.

On occasions when you need to send emails outside of working hours, you may consider adding the following:

> While I may be sending this email outside my normal office hours, I have no expectation to receive a reply outside yours.

### Working from home

On occasions when a work from home arrangement is necessary, please inform in advance your Line Manager/Supervisor as campus based working is encouraged for the purpose of team collaborations. Remember to set up a status update for email/SLACK if there will be a delay in you responding to colleagues.

### Booking Leave

Leave requests must to be forwarded to your Line Manager/Supervisor for prior approval. Please consider work schedules and commitments when planning leave.
