### Keeping our team safe

We are committed to the implementation and maintenance of the highest standards of health, safety and welfare and we all have an important role in maintaining a healthy and safe environment.

Whilst on University business, it is your responsibility to take reasonable care of your own and others' safety by adopting safe working practices and making proper use of the safety facilities provided.

You can do this by complying with University Health and Safety Policies and Codes of Practice, which cover activities conducted within, or on behalf of the University. This applies not only on University premises, but anywhere else that you may be working.

We all have a duty of care in the workplace, therefore if you see anything that may be a health and safety breach and is likely to cause harm, you must speak up and report it to the appropriate health and safety officials immediately.
