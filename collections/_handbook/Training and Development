### Professional growth, development and training

Take ownership for your own professional growth, development and training. Utilise the relevant training and development opportunities provided through the Staff Learning and Development Unit 

If specific development and training requirements are not provided in-house, speak to your Supervisor. Provision may be available to arrange group or individual training through an external provider. 

Actively develop and grow skills and expertise by taking your Professional Development Review (PDR) and One to One meetings seriously and invest time in the discussion and planning of your development. Discuss expectations and career aspirations and seek feedback.
