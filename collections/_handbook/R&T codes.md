Research and task codes for purchasing 

If you are making a purchase against the LightForm budget, you will need prior permission to do so from your Supervisor. 

It is important that we use the correct task codes when purchasing.
A task code will relate to the type of product or service you need to purchase, for example travel, consumables, accommodation etc.

These are the LightForm task codes, if you are unsure as to which task code to use, please contact Natalie Shannon Natalie.a.shannon@manchester.ac.uk
