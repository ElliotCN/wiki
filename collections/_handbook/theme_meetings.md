**Theme Meetings 

LightForm research projects are categorised into themes:

1.	Aluminium 
2.	Data & Modelling 
3.	Titanium & Magnesium 

Progress for each individual theme is reviewed in a weekly meeting, usually occurring on a Tuesday.
With a multisite team it is imperative that progress is shared, updated and recorded with engagement from all parties, in order to avoid working in isolation, therefore attendance at theme meetings is strongly recommended. 

Everyone is invited to the meeting, which will be co-delivered by a PDRA/Supervisor/PhD

**Input at theme meetings

Everyone is invited to give a brief update on their work, including:

•	Summary of activities/experiments 
•	Reporting of any technical difficulties (what has/hasn't worked) 
•	Experiment plans for the following month
•	Providing summary slide (as shown in the dropbox folder or on the Slack #titanium channel) summarising progress, plans and updates to milestones/deadlines  
•	Summary slides should be shared in advance of theme meetings, please forward to the Lead Researcher, at least one day prior to the scheduled meeting
