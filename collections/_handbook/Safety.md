You must attend the Health and Safety Induction and any specialised local safety training specified by your supervisor or the health and safety staff. 

There is detailed information in the Management System document ([here](https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/materials/health-and-safety/forms/)) on the how to carry out Risk and COSHH assessments for laboratory based work.
