**Flexible working hours**

Core campus working hours are 10am to 4.00am Monday to Friday in order to facilitate collaborative working. Meetings and events will not be arranged outside these hours. 
Exceptions for these core hours can be arranged in line with University and Departmental policy.

Avoid sending work-related email outside of 8.00am and 6.00pm, colleagues are not required, or should feel obliged to reply to emails outside of their typical work hours.

On occasions when you need to send emails outside of working hours, you may consider adding the following:

***"While I may be sending this email outside my normal office hours, I have no expectation to receive a reply outside yours"***
