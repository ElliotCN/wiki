**Fees and Expenses:
  
Items should only be claimed on Fees & Expenses forms for out of pocket travelling expenses when it is not possible to purchase an item by raising an order via a requisition. 

Please ensure the correct expense claim form is completed in full with all relevant information and ORIGINAL receipts are securely attached using staples rather than paperclips. 

The forms must be countersigned by your line manager or academic supervisor (for students). 

Forms can be downloaded at http://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/employment/expenses/  anyone who is on the University payroll (all staff and any students who do regular lab Demonstrating) must use the online form, download the form, attach receipts and obtain appropriate signatures. 

Please hand all completed forms to the Head of School Administration, Room D41, D floor, Sackville St. Building. 

Please ensure receipts are securely attached as expenses without original receipts may not be paid or may be taxed. It is advisable to keep a copy of the form and receipts for your own records. 

Where claims are made against receipts in a foreign currency overall totals must also be given in pounds sterling. The exchange rate at the time of reimbursement will be used for payment unless supporting documentation is attached (eg credit card statement with numbers blanked out showing amount paid in sterling, or evidence of currency exchange on the date of expenditure). 

Please note that claims relating to a specific event will not be reimbursed until after the event.
