There is detailed information in the Management System document on the
how to carry out Risk and COSHH assessments for laboratory based work.

-   You need to update/revise your Risk and COSHH assessment forms
    annually when your work changes.

You must familiarise yourself with your laboratories and pay attention
to all the safety documents relating to those areas. Safety equipment
such as safety glasses, laboratory coats, gloves and hard hats will be
issued as required and must be worn.

For Postgraduate Students there are also Compulsory Health & Safety
assessments on eProg.

The School safety policy and templates for risk assessments are
available on the Virtual Common Room.

If you have any questions regarding health and safety, please contact
your supervisor or the School Safety Advisor, Christopher Turnbull -
