## General TEM
This describes the metadata which applies to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments. TEM is a technique where electrons are fired at a very thin sample (10-30 nm) and the transmitted beam is measured. Under good conditions it is possible to resolve features on an atomic scale. An example output image is shown below.

### Adjustable Parameters
- Accelerating Voltage (KeV) - (Default: 200)
- Probe Current (nA) - (Default: 1)
- Magnification (Mx) - (Default 5.5)
- Sample Orientation Out of Plane (Z1) - (One of: ND(Normal), RD(Rolling), TD(Transverse), CD(Compression), R1(
Radial 1), R2(Radial 2), FD(Forging), DD(Draw), ED(Extrusion), RD(Radial), AD(Axial))
- Sample Orientation Up, North (Y1) - (As above)
- Sample Orientation Side, East (X1) - (As above)


## Setup Specific Metatdata
There are several different microscope setups which have the above data in common but also have some instrument specific metadata.
