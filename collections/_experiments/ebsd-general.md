title: EBSD - General

This describes the general metadata which applies to all EBSD experiments. EBSD is a technique where electrons are fired at a sample and the scattering of the electrons is analysed.

## Adjustable Parameters

- Sample Orientation Out of Plane (Z1) - (One of: ND(Normal), RD(Rolling), TD(Transverse), CD(Compression), R1(Radial 1), R2(Radial 2), FD(Forging), DD(Draw), ED(Extrusion), RD(Radial), AD(Axial))
- Sample Orientation Up, North (Y1) - (One of: ND(Normal), RD(Rolling), TD(Transverse), CD(Compression), R1(Radial 1), R2(Radial 2), FD(Forging), DD(Draw), ED(Extrusion), RD(Radial), AD(Axial))
- Sample Orientation Side, East (X1) - (One of: ND(Normal), RD(Rolling), TD(Transverse), CD(Compression), R1(Radial 1), R2(Radial 2), FD(Forging), DD(Draw), ED(Extrusion), RD(Radial), AD(Axial))
- Phase name (One or more of: Ti Hex, Ti Beta, Ti Cubic, Al Cubic)
